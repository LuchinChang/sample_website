            Learn Enough to Be <em>Dangerous</em> was <strong>found</strong> in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
            Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
            sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
            at least a billion people, and probably more. <em><strong>hihi</strong></em>
